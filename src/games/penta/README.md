# Penta

Penta is a demo game built on tiny-spaces that is a bit of an experiment to integrate LLMs into gameplay. In the game, the character is a new arrival to a cursed town and needs to talk to the townspeople to figure out what is going on and how to fix it. 

The game runs entirely in browser and the only dependencies are Braintrust and Pixi.js.
